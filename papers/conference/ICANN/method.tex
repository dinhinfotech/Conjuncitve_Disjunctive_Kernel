\section{Method}
\label{method}

Often the relational information that defines the network structure is
incomplete because certain relations are not known at a given moment in time
or have not been yet investigated. When this happens the resulting networks
tend to become sparse and composed of several disconnected components.
Diffusion-based kernels are not suited in these cases and show a degraded
predictive capacity. Our key idea is to introduce a {\em link enrichment
phase} that can address both issues and enhance the performance of diffusion-based systems.

Given a link prediction algorithm $M$, a diffusion-based graph node kernel $K$
and a sparse graph $G=(V, E)$ in which $|V| = n$ and $|E| = m$, with $m
\approx n$ the link enrichment method consists of two phases:

\begin{itemize}

\item enrichment: the link prediction algorithm $M$ is used to score all possible
$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-m$ missing links. The top scoring $t$ links are added to $E$
to obtain $E'$ that defines the new graph $G'=(V,E')$.

\item kernel computation: the diffusion-based graph node kernel $K$ is applied
to graph $G^{'}$ to compute the kernel matrix $K'$ which captures the similarities
between any couple of nodes, possibly belonging to different components in $G$. 
\end{itemize}

The kernel matrix $K'$ can be used directly by a kernelized learning
algorithm, such as a support vector machine, to make predictive inferences.
